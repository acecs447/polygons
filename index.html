			WRAPPING UP:

		<p>
			<b>1. Small individual bias &rarr; Large collective bias.</b>
			<br>
			<!--Micromotives, macrobehaviour...-->
			When someone says a culture is shapist, they're not saying the <i>individuals</i> in it are shapist.
			They're not attacking you personally.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>2. The past haunts the present.</b>
			<br>
			Your bedroom floor doesn't stop being dirty just coz you stopped dropping food all over the carpet.
			Creating equality is like staying clean: it takes work. And it's always a work in progress.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>3. Demand diversity near you.</b>
			<br>
			If small biases created the mess we're in, small anti-biases might fix it.
			Look around you. Your friends, your colleagues, that conference you're attending.
			If you're all triangles, you're missing out on some amazing squares in your life -
			that's unfair to everyone. Reach out, beyond your immediate neighbors.

				Our cute, adorable segregation simulator is based off the work of Nobel Prize-winning game theorist,
				Thomas Schelling. Specifically, his mathematical model of racial segregation found in
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/Schelling_Seg_Models.pdf">
				Dynamic Models of Segregation.</a>
				We built on top of his model, by showing how adding a small cultural demand for diversity can help
				desegregate a neighborhood. In other words, we gave his model a happy ending.

				<br><br>

				Schelling's model is a convincing demonstration of how
				<span cartoon="hat.jpg">innocent-seeming</span> rules
				can create very undesirable outcomes, but of course real-life situations are more complicated.
				You might enjoy taking a closer look at real data in reference to Schelling's model.
				W.A.V. Clark's 1991 paper <a target="_blank" href="http://smg.media.mit.edu/library/Clark.ResidentialSegregation.pdf">
				Residential Preferences and Neighborhood Racial Segregation: A Test of the Schelling Segregation Model</a>
				has a lot of interesting data in it.

				<br><br>

				Schelling's model explores one small aspect of how tiny bias can have large accumulative effects,
				but there's other models that focus on other aspects.
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~lane/papers/male_female.pdf">
				Male-Female Differences: A Computer Simulation</a>
				shows how extremely small differences in the perception of men and women's work can have huge effects.
				<a target="_blank" href="http://iangent.blogspot.com/2013/10/the-petrie-multiplier-why-attack-on.html">
				The Petrie Multiplier</a>
				explores how small negative actions of
				<span cartoon="not_all_triangles.jpg">a few bad apples</span>
				can become multiplied by certain situations.

				<br><br>

				The takeaway from our variant of Schelling's simulator is that demanding a single bit of diversity
				in your spaces makes a huge difference overall. For a real-world application of this idea,
				see <a target="_blank" href="http://plzdiversifyyourpanel.tumblr.com/">Plz Diversify Your Panel</a>,
				an initiative where overrepresented speakers refuse invitations
				to speak on panels that don't include diverse representation.

				<br><br>

				The format of this playable post was inspired by Bret Victor's work on 
				<a target="_blank" href="http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/">
				Explorable Explanations</a> and Ian Bogost's work on 
				<a target="_blank" href="http://bogost.com/books/persuasive_games/">
				procedural rhetoric</a>.
